# Conway-Game-of-Life
An implementation of Conway's classic cellular automation simulation

I heard on the grapevine that this is often a challenge given to potential employees and such. I decided to take on the challenge to test my skill and ability. While I was able to successfully complete it, I'm sure that some of my code could be more efficient/clean. 

Feel free to give it a run and let me know your thoughts.

TODO

- Turn some if not most of the functions into classes for better ease-of-use. Everything is just thrown in there for now
- Finish the character set which can be used as the initial seed for each simulation
